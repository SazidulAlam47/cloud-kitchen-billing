### 1. Project Name & Overview

**Project Title:** Cloud Kitchen Billing Dashboard (Frontend Only)

**Goal:**
Build a single-page web application for a Cloud Kitchen Billing System. The system manages two types of bills:

1. Corporate Billing – recurring meals delivered on selected dates.
2. Random Billing (Personal Event/Occasion) – one-off events with customized packages.

The app should allow an admin user to:

* Create, view, edit, and delete billing records.
* Manage packages for Corporate and Personal/Event billing.
* Dynamically calculate totals and show the amount in words.

The focus is on frontend skills (JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Redux, UI/UX fundamentals).
No backend is required; use local state or Redux store, and optionally mock APIs with JSON.

### 2. User Stories (Requirements)

#### 2.1 Common / Global

As an admin, I want a simple dashboard where I can:

* Switch between “Corporate Billing” and “Event Billing”.
* See a list of all bills (table or cards).
* Click on any bill to view details and edit/delete.

As an admin, I want basic validation for required fields (e.g., contact no, name, date, package list).

### 2.2 Corporate Billing

**Scenario:**
Corporate clients purchase packages on multiple dates in a month. Each date entry includes number of persons, unit price, and total.

**Required fields for Corporate bill:**

* Corporate Name (e.g., X Ltd)
* Contact Person (e.g., XYZ)
* Contact No (e.g., 0178888)
* Billing Date (e.g., 04/01/2025)
* Billing Type: Corporate
* Number of Packages (Summary) – calculated or input based on total persons
* Line Items (Dates-wise consumption):

  * Service Date (e.g., 01/01/2025)
  * Package Type (Economy / Standard / Premium)
  * Number of Persons
  * Unit Price (BDT)
  * Line Total (auto-calculated: persons × unit price)

**Example (given):**
(Shown as an image invoice with labels such as)

* Bill
* Contact Person
* Contact No
* Date
* Number of Pax
* Sl. No
* Date
* Person
* Unit Price
* Total BDT
* Total Amount
* Amount in Words
* Sincerely
* CEO
* MetroChef



### 2.3 Random Billing (Personal Event / Occasion)

**Scenario:**
A person or company orders for one specific event, with one or more food packages.

**Required fields for Event bill:**

* Event Name (e.g., X Event)
* Contact Person (e.g., XYZ)
* Contact No (e.g., 0178888)
* Event Date (e.g., 04/01/2025)
* Billing Type: Event
* Number of Packages (Total persons or package count)
* Package Items:

  * Package Name (e.g., Package-1, or custom text)
  * Package Type (Economy / Standard / Premium or custom)
  * Description / Name of food items (short text)
  * Number of Persons
  * Unit Price (BDT)
  * Line Total (auto: persons × unit price)

**Example (given):**

* Event Name: X event
* Contact Person: XYZ
* Contact No: 0178888
* Date: 04/01/2025
* Number of Packages: 60

1. Package-1 (Name of food items) – Persons (30) – Unit price (200 BDT) – Total: 6,000 BDT
2. Package-2 (Name of food items) – Persons (10) – Unit price (400 BDT) – Total: 4,000 BDT

**Total Amount:** 10,000 BDT
**Amount in words:** BDT – Ten Thousand Only

Same as corporate: calculate total & amount in words automatically.



### 2.4 Admin Actions (CRUD)

For both Corporate and Event billing:

**Create New Bill**

* Form with inputs described above.
* Add multiple line items (dates or packages) using “Add Row” button.

**Edit Bill**

* Open an existing bill, modify any field.

**Delete Bill**

* Remove a bill with confirmation.

**List View**
Show a list (table) of all bills with:

* ID / Invoice No
* Name (Corporate Name / Event Name)
* Billing Type (Corporate / Event)
* Date
* Total Amount
* Actions: View / Edit / Delete

For simplicity, you can store all bills in a Redux store or React state. No real backend needed.



### 3. UI/UX Expectations

Ask candidates to show their UI/UX sense, not just code:

* Clean layout using Tailwind CSS.
* Responsive design (at least works on desktop and basic mobile).
* Clear separation:

  * Sidebar/Topbar for navigation.
  * Main content for forms and tables.
* Use meaningful components:

  * Buttons, inputs, labels, cards, tables.
* Visual feedback:

  * Disabled “Save” button if required fields are missing.
  * Error messages under inputs or as small toast (if they want to use a library).

Optional but nice:

* Light theming (e.g., primary colors, consistent typography).
* Simple icons (e.g., for edit/delete).



### 4. Technical Requirements

#### 4.1 Stack

* React (with functional components + hooks)
* Redux or Redux Toolkit for state management
* Tailwind CSS for styling
* Plain JavaScript or TypeScript (your choice)

#### 4.2 State Management

Recommended slices in Redux:

* **billing slice**

  * corporateBills: []
  * eventBills: []
* **packages slice (optional)**

  * Predefined package types & default unit prices

**Actions:**

* addCorporateBill, updateCorporateBill, deleteCorporateBill
* addEventBill, updateEventBill, deleteEventBill
